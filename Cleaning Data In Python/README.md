# Loading and viewing your data
In this chapter, you're going to look at a subset of the Department of Buildings Job Application Filings dataset from 
the NYC Open Data portal. This dataset consists of job applications filed on January 22, 2017.
Your first task is to load this dataset into a DataFrame and then inspect it using the .head() 
and .tail() methods. However, you'll find out very quickly that the printed results don't allow
you to see everything you need, since there are too many columns. Therefore, you need to look at
the data in another way. The .shape and .columns attributes let you see the shape of the DataFrame
and obtain a list of its columns. From here, you can see which columns are relevant to the questions 
you'd like to ask of the data. To this end, a new DataFrame, df_subset, consisting only of these relevant
columns, has been pre-loaded. This is the DataFrame you'll work with in the rest of the chapter.
Get acquainted with the dataset now by exploring it with pandas.This initial exploratory analysis is a crucial first step of data cleaning.

## Instructions

* Import pandas as pd.
* Read 'dob_job_application_filings_subset.csv' into a DataFrame called df.
* Print the head and tail of df.
* Print the shape of df and its columns. Note: .shape and .columns are attributes, not methods, so you don't need to follow these with parentheses ().
* Hit 'Submit Answer' to view the results! Notice the suspicious number of 0 values. Perhaps these represent missing data.

```python

# Import pandas
import pandas as pd

# Read the file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv('dob_job_application_filings_subset.csv')
# Print the head of df
print(df.head())

# Print the tail of df
print(df.tail())

# Print the shape of df
print(df.shape)

# Print the columns of df
print(df.columns)

# Print the head and tail of df_subset
print(df_subset.head())
print(df_subset.tail())
```
# Further diagnosis
In the previous exercise, you identified some potentially unclean or missing data. Now, you'll continue to diagnose your data with the very useful .info() method. The .info() method provides important information about a DataFrame, such as the number of rows, number of columns, number of non-missing values in each column, and the data type stored in each column. This is the kind of information that will allow you to confirm whether the 'Initial Cost' and 'Total Est. Fee' columns are numeric or strings. From the results, you'll also be able to see whether or not all columns have complete data in them. 
The full DataFrame df and the subset DataFrame df_subset have been pre-loaded. Your task is to use the .info() method on these and analyze the results.

```python

# Print the info of df
print(df.info())
# Print the info of df_subset
print(df_subset.info())
```
# Calculating summary statistics

You'll now use the .describe() method to calculate summary statistics of your data.
In this exercise, the columns 'Initial Cost' and 'Total Est. Fee' have been cleaned up for you. That is, the dollar sign has been removed and they have been converted into two new numeric columns: initial_cost and total_est_fee. You'll learn how to do this yourself in later chapters. It's also worth noting that some columns such as Job # are encoded as numeric columns, but it does not make sense to compute summary statistics for such columns.
This cleaned DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df. Your job is to use the .describe() method on it in the IPython Shell and select the statement below that is False.

# Frequency counts for categorical data

As you've seen, .describe() can only be used on numeric columns. So how can you diagnose data issues when you have categorical data?
One way is by using the .value_counts() method, which returns the frequency counts for each unique value in a column!
This method also has an optional parameter called dropna which is True by default. What this means is if you have missing data in a column, it will not give a frequency count of them. You want to set the dropna column to False so if there are missing values in a column, it will give you the frequency counts.
In this exercise, you're going to look at the 'Borough', 'State', and 'Site Fill' columns to make sure all the values in there are valid. When looking at the output, do a sanity check: Are all values in the 'State' column from NY, for example? Since the dataset consists of applications filed in NY, you would expect this to be the case.

```python

# Print the value counts for 'Borough'
print(df['Borough'].value_counts(dropna=False))

# Print the value_counts for 'State'
print(df['State'].value_counts(dropna=False))

# Print the value counts for 'Site Fill'
print(df['Site Fill'].value_counts(dropna=False))
```
# Visualizing single variables with histograms

Up until now, you've been looking at descriptive statistics of your data. One of the best ways to confirm what the numbers are telling you is to plot and visualize the data.
You'll start by visualizing single variables using a histogram for numeric values. The column you will work on in this exercise is    ```Existing Zoning Sqft```.

The **.plot()** method allows you to create a plot of each column of a DataFrame. The kind parameter allows you to specify the type of plot to use - kind='hist', for example, plots a histogram.

In the IPython Shell, begin by computing summary statistics for the 'Existing Zoning Sqft' column using the .describe() method. You'll notice that there are extremely large differences between the min and max values, and the plot will need to be adjusted accordingly. In such cases, it's good to look at the plot on a log scale. The keyword arguments logx=True or logy=True can be passed in to .plot() depending on which axis you want to rescale.

Finally, note that Python will render a plot such that the axis will hold all the information. That is, if you end up with large amounts of whitespace in your plot, it indicates counts or values too small to render.

## Instructions
* Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
* Create a histogram of the 'Existing Zoning Sqft' column. Rotate the axis labels by 70 degrees and use a log scale for both axes.
* Display the histogram using plt.show().

```python

# Import matplotlib.pyplot
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot the histogram
df['Existing Zoning Sqft'].plot(kind='hist', rot=70, logx=True, logy=True)

# Display the histogram
plt.show()
```
# Visualizing multiple variables with boxplots

Histograms are great ways of visualizing single variables. To visualize multiple variables, boxplots are useful, especially when one of the variables is categorical. 
In this exercise, your job is to use a boxplot to compare the 'initial_cost' across the different values of the 'Borough' column. The pandas .boxplot() method is a quick way to do this, in which you have to specify the column and by parameters. Here, you want to visualize how 'initial_cost' varies by 'Borough'.
pandas and matplotlib.pyplot have been imported for you as pd and plt, respectively, and the DataFrame has been pre-loaded as df.

## Instructions

* using the .boxplot() method of df, create a boxplot of 'initial_cost' across the different values of 'Borough'.
* Display the plot.

```python

# Import necessary modules
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create the boxplot
df.boxplot(column='initial_cost', by='Borough', rot=90)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

# Visualizing multiple variables with scatter plots
Boxplots are great when you have a numeric column that you want to compare across different categories. When you want to visualize two numeric columns, scatter plots are ideal.

In this exercise, your job is to make a scatter plot with 'initial_cost' on the x-axis and the 'total_est_fee' on the y-axis. You can do this by using the DataFrame .plot() method with kind='scatter'. You'll notice right away that there are 2 major outliers shown in the plots.

Since these outliers dominate the plot, an additional DataFrame, df_subset, has been provided, in which some of the extreme values have been removed. After making a scatter plot using this, you'll find some interesting patterns here that would not have been seen by looking at summary statistics or 1 variable plots.

When you're done, you can cycle between the two plots by clicking the 'Previous Plot' and 'Next Plot' buttons below the plot.

## Instructions

* Using df, create a scatter plot (kind='scatter') with 'initial_cost' on the x-axis and the 'total_est_fee' on the y-axis. Rotate the x-axis labels by 70 degrees.
* Create another scatter plot exactly as above, substituting df_subset in place of df.

```python

# Import necessary modules
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create and display the first scatter plot
df.plot(kind='scatter', x='initial_cost', y='total_est_fee', rot=70)
plt.show()

# Create and display the second scatter plot
df_subset.plot(kind='scatter', x='initial_cost', y='total_est_fee', rot=70)
plt.show()
```

# Recognizing tidy data

For data to be tidy, it must have:

* Each variable as a separate column.
* Each row as a separate observation

As a data scientist, you'll encounter data that is represented in a variety of different ways, so it is important to be able to recognize tidy (or untidy) data when you see it

In this exercise, two example datasets have been pre-loaded into the DataFrames df1 and df2. Only one of them is tidy. Your job is to explore these further in the IPython Shell and identify the one that is not tidy, and why it is not tidy.

In the rest of this course, you will frequently be asked to explore the structure of DataFrames in the IPython Shell prior to performing different operations on them. Doing this will not only strengthen your comprehension of the data cleaning concepts covered in this course, but will also help you realize and take advantage of the relationship between working in the Shell and in the script.


# Reshaping your data using melt
Melting data is the process of turning columns of your data into rows of data. Consider the DataFrames from the previous exercise. In the tidy DataFrame, the variables Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp each had their own column. If, however, you wanted these variables to be in rows instead, you could melt the DataFrame. In doing so, however, you would make the data untidy! This is important to keep in mind: Depending on how your data is represented, you will have to reshape it differently.
In this exercise, you will practice melting a DataFrame using pd.melt(). There are two parameters you should be aware of: id_vars and value_vars. The id_vars represent the columns of the data you do not want to melt (i.e., keep it in its current shape), while the value_vars represent the columns you do wish to melt into rows. By default, if no value_vars are provided, all columns not set in the id_vars will be melted. This could save a bit of typing, depending on the number of columns that need to be melted


The (tidy) DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded. Your job is to melt its Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns into rows. Later in this chapter, you'll learn how to bring this melted DataFrame back into a tidy form.

## Instructions
* Print the head of airquality.
* Use pd.melt() to melt the Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns of airquality into rows. Do this by using id_vars to specify the columns you do not wish to melt: 'Month' and 'Day'.
* Print the head of airquality_melt

```python

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'])

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())
```
# Customizing melted data

When melting DataFrames, it would be better to have column names more meaningful than variable and value.
The default names may work in certain situations, but it's best to always have data that is self explanatory.
You can rename the variable column by specifying an argument to the var_name parameter, and the value column by specifying an argument to the value_name parameter. You will now practice doing exactly this. The DataFrame airquality has been pre-loaded for you.

## Instructions

* Print the head of airquality.
* Melt the Ozone, Solar.R, Wind, and Temp columns of airquality into rows, with the default variable column renamed to 'measurement' and * the default value column renamed to 'reading'. You can do this by specifying, respectively, the var_name and value_name parameters.
* Print the head of airquality_melt.

```python

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())

# Melt airquality: airquality_melt
airquality_melt = pd.melt(airquality, id_vars=['Month', 'Day'], var_name='measurement', value_name='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())
```
# Pivot data
Pivoting data is the opposite of melting it. Remember the tidy form that the airquality DataFrame was in before you melted it? You'll now begin pivoting it back into that form using the .pivot_table() method!
While melting takes a set of columns and turns it into a single column, pivoting will create a new column for each unique value in a specified column.
.pivot_table() has an index parameter which you can use to specify the columns that you don't want pivoted: It is similar to the id_vars parameter of pd.melt(). Two other parameters that you have to specify are columns (the name of the column you want to pivot), and values (the values to be used when the column is pivoted). The melted DataFrame airquality_melt has been pre-loaded for you.

## Instructions
* Print the head of airquality_melt.
* Pivot airquality_melt by using .pivot_table() with the rows indexed by 'Month' and 'Day', the columns indexed by 'measurement', and the values populated with 'reading'.
* Print the head of airquality_pivot.

```python

# Print the head of airquality_melt
print(airquality_melt.head())

# Pivot airquality_melt: airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_melt.pivot_table(index=['Month', 'Day'], columns='measurement', values='reading')

# Print the head of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.head())
```
# Resetting the index of a DataFrame
After pivoting airquality_melt in the previous exercise, you didn't quite get back the original DataFrame.

What you got back instead was a pandas DataFrame with a hierarchical index (also known as a MultiIndex).
Hierarchical indexes are covered in depth in Manipulating DataFrames with pandas. In essence, they allow you to group columns or rows by another variable - in this case, by 'Month' as well as 'Day'. 

There's a very simple method you can use to get back the original DataFrame from the pivoted DataFrame: .reset_index(). Dan didn't show you how to use this method in the video, but you're now going to practice using it in this exercise to get back the original DataFrame from airquality_pivot, which has been pre-loaded.

## Instructions
* Print the index of airquality_pivot by accessing its .index attribute. This has been done for you.
* Reset the index of airquality_pivot using its .reset_index() method.
* Print the new index of airquality_pivot.
* Print the head of airquality_pivot.

```python

# Print the index of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.index)

# Reset the index of airquality_pivot: airquality_pivot_reset
airquality_pivot_reset = airquality_pivot.reset_index()

# Print the new index of airquality_pivot_reset
print(airquality_pivot_reset.index)

# Print the head of airquality_pivot_reset
print(airquality_pivot_reset.head())
```
# Pivoting duplicate values
So far, you've used the .pivot_table() method when there are multiple index values you want to hold constant during a pivot. In the video, Dan showed you how you can also use pivot tables to deal with duplicate values by providing an aggregation function through the aggfunc parameter. Here, you're going to combine both these uses of pivot tables.

Let's say your data collection method accidentally duplicated your dataset. Such a dataset, in which each row is duplicated, has been pre-loaded as airquality_dup. In addition, the airquality_melt DataFrame from the previous exercise has been pre-loaded. Explore their shapes in the IPython Shell by accessing their .shape attributes to confirm the duplicate rows present in airquality_dup.

You'll see that by using .pivot_table() and the aggfunc parameter, you can not only reshape your data, but also remove duplicates. Finally, you can then flatten the columns of the pivoted DataFrame using .reset_index().
NumPy and pandas have been imported as np and pd respectively.

## Instructions
* Pivot airquality_dup by using .pivot_table() with the rows indexed by 'Month' and 'Day', the columns indexed by 'measurement', and the values populated with 'reading'. Use np.mean for the aggregation function. 
* Flatten airquality_pivot by resetting its index.
* Print the head of airquality_pivot and then the original airquality DataFrame to compare their structure.

```python

# Pivot airquality_dup: airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_dup.pivot_table (index=['Month', 'Day'], columns='measurement', values='reading', aggfunc=np.mean)

# Reset the index of airquality_pivot
airquality_pivot = airquality_pivot.reset_index()

# Print the head of airquality_pivot
print(airquality_pivot.head())

# Print the head of airquality
print(airquality.head())
```
# Splitting a column with .str
The dataset you saw in the video, consisting of case counts of tuberculosis by country, year, gender, and age group, has been pre-loaded into a DataFrame as tb.

In this exercise, you're going to tidy the 'm014' column, which represents males aged 0-14 years of age. In order to parse this value, you need to extract the first letter into a new column for gender, and the rest into a column for age_group. Here, since you can parse values by position, you can take advantage of pandas' vectorized string slicing by using the str attribute of columns of type object.

Begin by printing the columns of tb in the IPython Shell using its .columns attribute, and take note of the problematic column.
## Instructions
* Melt tb keeping 'country' and 'year' fixed.
* Create a 'gender' column by slicing the first letter of the variable column of tb_melt.
* Create an 'age_group' column by slicing the rest of the variable column of tb_melt.
* Print the head of tb_melt. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the results!

```python

# Melt tb: tb_melt
tb_melt = pd.melt(frame=df, id_vars=['country', 'year'])

# Create the 'gender' column
tb_melt['gender'] = tb_melt.variable.str[0]

# Create the 'age_group' column
tb_melt['age_group'] = tb_melt.variable.str[1:]

# Print the head of tb_melt
print(tb_melt.head())
```
