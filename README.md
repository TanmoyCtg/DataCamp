<b>First Course of Data Analyst with Python</b>
<h1>Intro to Python For Data Science</h1>
<p>
<h2>Python Basics</h2>
An introduction to the basic concepts of Python. Learn how to use Python both interactively and through a script. Create your first variables and acquaint yourself with Python's basic data types. 

<b>First Problem Exercise No = 1</b>
<li>The Python Interface</li>
In the Python script on the right, you can type Python code to solve the exercises. If you hit Run Code or Submit Answer, your python script (script.py) is executed and the output is shown in the IPython Shell. Submit Answer checks whether your submission is correct and gives you feedback.
You can hit Run Code and Submit Answer as often as you want. If you're stuck, you can click Get Hint, and ultimately Get Solution.
You can also use the IPython Shell interactively by simply typing commands and hitting Enter. When you work in the shell directly, your code will not be checked for correctness so it is a great way to experiment

<li>Experiment in the IPython Shell; type 5 / 8, for example.</li>
<li>Add another line of code to the Python script: print(7 + 10).</li>
<li>Hit Submit Answer to execute the Python script and receive feedback.</li>
