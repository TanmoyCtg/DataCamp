# Inspecting your data
You can use the DataFrame methods .head() and .tail() to view the first few and last few rows of a DataFrame. In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and loaded population data from 1960 to 2014 as a DataFrame df. This dataset was obtained from the World Bank.

Your job is to use df.head() and df.tail() to verify that the first and last rows match a file on disk. In later exercises, you will see how to extract values from DataFrames with indexing, but for now, manually copy/paste or type values into assignment statements where needed. Select the correct answer for the first and last values in the 'Year' and 'Total Population' columns.
